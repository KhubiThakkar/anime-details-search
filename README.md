# Anime Searching Portal

## Requirement

It is a search page to show search results with fields described below:
- Shows max 15 results on the single page
- Shows a warning message, if there is no result returned for a given search query
- By default, the page shows the top 15 characters if the user did not search anything
- Show the user pagination button to go “Next” or “Back". Clicking on the next button shows next 15 records or so
